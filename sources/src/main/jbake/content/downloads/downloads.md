## Apache Roller Releases

Releases of the Apache Roller blog server are made available to the general public at no charge, under the <a href="http://apache.org/licenses/">Apache License,</a> in both binary and source distributions.

### General Availability (GA) Releases</strong> - <em>Ready for Prime Time!</em>
__<a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/roller/roller-6.0/v6.0.2">Roller 6.0.2</a> (&quot;best available&quot;)__

Previous source and binary distributions, including documentation, are available in the <a class="external" href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/roller/">Apache archives</a>.

Project releases are approved by vote of the Apache Roller Project Management Committee (PMC). Support for a release is provided by project volunteers on the project <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ROLLER/How+to+ask+for+help">mailing lists</a>. Bugs found in a release may be discussed on the list and reported through the <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ROL">issue tracker</a>. The user mailing list and issue tracker are the <strong>only</strong> support options hosted by the Apache Roller project.

Note: When downloading from a mirror, be sure to verify that checksums and/or signatures are correct. To do so, use the checksum and signature files from the main Apache site at <a class="external" href="http://www.apache.org/dist/roller/">http://www.apache.org/dist/roller/</a>.

The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the <a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/roller/KEYS">KEYS</a> as well as the ``asc`` signature file for the particular distribution. Make sure you get these files from the <a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/roller/">main distribution directory,</a> rather than from a mirror. Then verify the signatures using ``pgpk`` as follows:

    % pgpk -a KEYS
    % pgpv ${filename}.tar.gz.asc

or

    % pgp -ka KEYS
    % pgp ${filename}.tar.gz.asc
     
or

    % gpg --import KEYS
    % gpg --verify ${filename}.tar.gz.asc

Alternatively you can also verify the SHA256 checksum for each file. Apache Open Office provides a nice guide to verifying checksum here <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/download/checksums.html">How to verify the integrity of the downloaded file?</a>

If you want to build directly from the sources, please check the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ROLLER/How+to+build+Roller">Project Wiki</a>.
